abstract = {Life expectancy is one of the major key indicators of population health and economic development of a country. The main objective of this study was to determine the impact of life expectancy on changes of economic growth and health care expenditure. We also examined trend of life expectancy according to the sex difference. We used multiple regression models to estimate the impact of life expectancy on economic growth and health care expenditure. Elasticity of life expectancy on health care expenditure and economic growth is also estimated. Results show greater life expectancy of females compared with the males over the past 15 years. The higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was observed in a longer life expectancy. i.e., one US Dollar (USD) increment in GDP per capita will increase in an average of life expectancy by 33 days. Similarly, increased one unit of per person Health Expenditure Per Capita (HEPC) will increase the life expectancy in an average of 8 days in a year. The higher proportion of total expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP and direct personal expenditure on health by household as a share of private expenditure on health results in also longer life span. We conclude that the increased life expectancy has direct impact on increased per capita real income and higher expenditure on health. This study has some policy implications for Bangladesh, in particular the needs for increased per capita real income and planning for future health and population policies/programs. Therefore, political stability, adequate and suitable social sector policies and government interventions are required to increase life expectancy and economic growth in the country. There is also a need for involvement of health human force in macro and micro policy-makings and critically examine other determinants of health care expenditure.},

abstract = {We set up a simple overlapping generation model that allows us to distin-guish between life expectancy and active life expectancy. We show that individuals optimally adjust to a longer active life by educating more and, if the labor supply elasticity is high enough, by supplying less labor. When calibrated to US data the model explains the historical evolution of increasing education and declining labor supply (of cohorts born 1850-1950) as an optimal response to increasing active life expectancy. We integrate the theory into a unified growth model and reestablish increasing life expectancy as an engine of long-run economic development.},

@article{Kentor2017,
abstract = {Purpose Recent sociological research highlights the growth of military expenditures in hi-tech, capital-intensive armaments and technology. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of these capital-intensive expenditures on two related health outcomes: under-five mortality and life expectancy. Design/methodology/approach This research utilizes a series of cross-national panel models estimated for a diverse sample of developed and less-developed countries from 1975 to 2000. Findings The authors find that hi-tech military expenditures increase under-five mortality and reduce life expectancy over the period studied, by reducing the number and type of soldiers able to take advantage of increased health-related resources obtained in the military and indirectly, by increasing income inequality, which negatively impacts these health outcomes. Research limitations/implications This cross-national study should be supplemented by case studies to better understand the processes being examined. Practical implications The increase in capital-intensive military expenditures found worldwide reduces the total number of soldiers in the military and raises their enlistment requirements. This makes it difficult for people with limited human capital to take advantage of the military's traditional pathway for upward mobility. New pathways for mobility will have to be developed to avoid the creation of a new permanent underclass. Social implications There are significant social policy implications for the findings. Hi-tech military expenditures have a significant negative impact on the short- and long-term health outcomes of children and adults, in both developed and less-developed countries, which must be addressed by public policy planners. Originality/value This is one of a handful of sociological studies on the impact of military establishment on society. These findings highlight the importance of "bringing the military back in" to the forefront of sociological research.},

@article{Kentor2008,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}After the peace bonus era, global military expenditures have escalated sharply despite some worldwide declines in military personnel. Theories on the economic impacts of the military institution and escalated military spending greatly differ and include arguments that they either improve domestic economic performance or crowd out growth-inducing processes. Empirical findings on this matter are inconclusive, in part due to a failure to disentangle the various dimensions of military expenditures. We further suggest that modern sociology's relative inattention to such issues has contributed to these shortcomings. We explore a new dimension of military spending that clarifies this issue military expenditures per soldier which captures the capital intensiveness of a country s military organization. Our cross-national panel regression and causal analyses of developed and less developed countries from 1990 to 2003 show that military expenditures per soldier inhibit the growth of per capita GDP, net of control variables, with the most pronounced effects in least developed countries. These expenditures inhibit national development in part by slowing the expansion of the labor force. Labor-intensive militaries may provide a pathway for upward mobility, but comparatively capital-intensive military organizations limit entry opportunities for unskilled and under- or unemployed people. Deep investments in military hardware also reduce the investment capital available for more economically productive opportunities. We also find that arms imports have a positive effect on economic growth, but only in less developed countries.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
